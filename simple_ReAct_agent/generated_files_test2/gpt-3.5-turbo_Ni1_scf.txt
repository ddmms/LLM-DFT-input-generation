Can you generate the Quantum Espresso input file for compound Ni1 for energy calculation             for PBE functional and efficiency mode?             The name of the parent folder with pseudopotentials is pseudos.            Determine the path to the folder with the correct pseudopotentials.            Get the list of names of files with pseudopotentials for the compound.            The directory with cutoffs is pseudo_cutoffs.             Read the structure file structure_files/Ni_ICSD_037502.cif to determine formula, atomic positions and unit cell vectors.            Choose a conventional unit cell if True is False, and convert it to primitive cell if True is True.             Check that the energy cutoff and density cutoff are not larger than the maximum cutoff values             for pseudopotentials used.            Now generate the Quantum Espresso input file for Ni1.

This input file sets up a self-consistent field (SCF) calculation for the compound Ni1 using the PBE functional and efficiency mode pseudopotentials. The unit cell is defined with the provided cell vectors, atomic positions, and pseudopotential file. The energy cutoff (ecutwfc) and density cutoff (ecutrho) values are within the maximum cutoff limits specified for the pseudopotentials.
