Can you generate the Quantum Espresso input file for compound Ba1 Ti1 O3 for energy calculation             for PBE functional and efficiency mode?             The name of the parent folder with pseudopotentials is pseudos.            Determine the path to the folder with the correct pseudopotentials.            Get the list of names of files with pseudopotentials for the compound.            The directory with cutoffs is pseudo_cutoffs.             Read the structure file structure_files/BaTiO3_ICSD_019801.cif to determine formula, atomic positions and unit cell vectors.            Choose a conventional unit cell if True is False, and convert it to primitive cell if True is True.             Check that the energy cutoff and density cutoff are not larger than the maximum cutoff values             for pseudopotentials used.            Now generate the Quantum Espresso input file for Ba1 Ti1 O3.

### Notes:
1. **Cutoff Values**: The energy cutoff (`ecutwfc`) and density cutoff (`ecutrho`) can be adjusted. The provided values are set below the maximum cutoffs (30.0 for `ecutwfc` and 240.0 for `ecutrho`) to ensure they are within the safe range.
2. **Pseudopotentials**: Ensure that the pseudopotential files are correctly placed in the specified directory.
3. **Atomic Positions and Cell Vectors**: The atomic positions were taken from the structure file as requested.
4. **K-Points**: The k-point grid is set to 6x6x6; you can adjust this based on the desired accuracy.

Make sure to check the final input file for any specific requirements of your computational setup before running the calculation.
