Can you generate the Quantum Espresso input file for compound Na1 Cl1 for energy calculation             for PBE functional and efficiency mode?             The name of the parent folder with pseudopotentials is pseudos.            Determine the path to the folder with the correct pseudopotentials.            Get the list of names of files with pseudopotentials for the compound.            The directory with cutoffs is pseudo_cutoffs.             Read the structure file structure_files/NaCl_ICSD_029929.cif to determine formula, atomic positions and unit cell vectors.            Choose a conventional unit cell if True is False, and convert it to primitive cell if True is True.             Check that the energy cutoff and density cutoff are not larger than the maximum cutoff values             for pseudopotentials used.            Now generate the Quantum Espresso input file for Na1 Cl1.

This input file provides the necessary parameters for performing a single point energy calculation on NaCl with Quantum Espresso. The pseudopotentials are specified, and the cutoff values are set based on the maximum allowable values for the chosen pseudopotentials. The cell parameters and atomic positions are derived from the primitive cell configuration of the NaCl structure.
