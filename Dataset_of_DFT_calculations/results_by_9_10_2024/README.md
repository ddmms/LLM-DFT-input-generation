This folder contains first DFT simulation results for the  test dataset. The issues are: <br>
(1) recommended cutoffs for PBEsol precision SSSP v1.3 pseudopotentials in some cases seem to be too low; <br>
(2)  We do not observe convergence for some elements with respect to k_points (preliminary attributed to too small energy and/or density cutoffs); <br>
(3) Calculations with ‘david’ diagonalisation with 1e-8 convergence threshold in some of my calculations did not converge (suggested to use conjugated gradient method for diagonalisation).
