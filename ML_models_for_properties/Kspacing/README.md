# Models to predict Kspacing from composition

Here some models for predicting kspacing from composition are collected. At the moment kspacing data are taken from Jarvis 3d_dft dataset.

## Random Forrest


## CrabNet


## CrabNet transfer from formation energy per one atom

## CrabNet transfer from total energy per one atom

## CrabNet transfer from density

## Conclusion

All these models have approximately the same performance. And we would like to have something better.

Some trained models can be found in the goldilocks folder on sharepoint
