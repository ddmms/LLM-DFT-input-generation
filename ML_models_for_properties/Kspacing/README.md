# Models to predict Kspacing from composition

Here some models for predicting kspacing from composition are collected. At the moment kspacing data are taken from Jarvis 3d_dft dataset.

## Random Forrest


## CrabNet


## CrabNet transfer from formation energy per one atom

## CrabNet transfer from total energy per one atom

## CrabNet transfer from density
