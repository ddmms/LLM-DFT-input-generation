<b>Data sources and description</b>: <br>

<ul>
  <li> The notebook MP_download_bandgap allows to download the latest available version of band gaps from MP 
    together with magnetic properties and structures. Calculation methodology https://docs.materialsproject.org/methodology/materials-methodology/electronic-structure 
    </li>
  <li>There is also Jarvis 3d and 2d DFT datasets, which have band gaps calculated with different functionals</li>
  <li>Small experimental band gap dataset from matbench</li>
  <li>The band gap dataset automatically extracted from papers (Bandgap_database_v2). The reference: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01294-6</li>
