Unaries contain input files with unaries (Li, B, C, etc with different structures (not necessarily observed in the real world)) (2840 files)

Oxides contain input files of oxides M_xO_y with different stoichiometries (x,y) (also not necessarily observed or corresponding to known oxidation states) (4621 files)

There is also a python notebook used to extract data from aiida archive
