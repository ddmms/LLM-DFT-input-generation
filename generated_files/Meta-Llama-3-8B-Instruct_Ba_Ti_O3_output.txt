Here is a sample input file for a single point energy calculation on BaTiO3 using Quantum Espresso:
```
&control
  calculation ='scf'
  prefix = 'BaTiO3'
  pseudo_dir = '/path/to/pseudopotentials'
  outdir = './outdir'
  verbosity = 'high'
  tstress =.true.
  tprnfor =.true.
/

&system
  ibrav = 0
  celldm(1) = 3.995  # lattice parameter in Angstrom
  celldm(2) = 3.995
  celldm(3) = 3.995
  nat = 3
  ntyp = 3
  ecutwfc = 30  # plane wave cutoff in Ry
  ecutrho = 120  # charge density cutoff in Ry
/

&electrons
  electron_maxstep = 100
  electron_mixing_beta = 0.5
  electron_diis_window = 8
/

&ions
  ion_dynamics ='verlet'
  ion_positions = 'ba 0.0 0.0 0.0; ti 0.5 0.5 0.5; o 0.0 0.5 0.5'
/

&pseudo
  PAW_PZ = 'Ba_Ba.pz'
  PAW_PZ = 'Ti_Ti.pz'
  PAW_PZ = 'O_O.pz'
/

ATOMIC_POSITIONS crystal
  Ba  0.0 0.0 0.0
  Ti  0.5 0.5 0.5
  O   0.0 0.5 0.5
```
This input file assumes that you have the following pseudopotentials in the `/path/to/pseudopotentials` directory:

* `Ba_Ba.pz` for Barium
* `Ti_Ti.pz` for Titanium
* `O_O.pz` for Oxygen

The lattice parameters are set to match the experimental values for BaTiO3. The `ecutwfc` and `ecutrho` values are set to reasonable values for a single point energy calculation. The `electron_maxstep` and `electron_mixing_beta` values are set to default values, but you may need to adjust them depending on the convergence of your calculation.

Note that you will need to create the pseudopotentials for Ba, Ti, and O atoms and place them in the specified directory. You can use the `pw.x` code to generate the pseudopotentials from a set of atomic wavefunctions and densities.

Also, you can adjust the `ion_positions` line to specify the initial positions of the ions. In this case, the positions are set to the ideal positions in the perovskite structure.

You can run the calculation by executing the following command:
```
pw.x -in BaTiO3.in -outdir outdir
```
This will generate the output files in the `outdir` directory.
